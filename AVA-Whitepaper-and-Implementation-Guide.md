## Introduction

Welcome to the AVA (Automated Voice Assistant) internal development guide. This document outlines the technical, strategic, and operational roadmap for AVA, focusing on modularity, open-source collaboration, and competitive positioning.

---

## Admin-Mode Simulation

The **admin-mode simulation** feature, initially developed for internal testing and debugging, is a powerful asset for contributors. When properly documented and enhanced, it allows developers to test module additions or changes in isolation, accelerating community involvement and feature development.

---

## Tagging/Ticketing System for Modular Contributions

A well-organized issue tracking system is fundamental for managing contributions to a modular project like AVA.

- **Issue Templates:** Standardized templates for:
    - Bug Reports
    - Feature Requests
    - Documentation Issues

- **Labeling Strategy:**
    - By Module/Component: `module:RAG-pipeline`, `module:BehaviorEngine`, etc.
    - By Type: `type:bug`, `type:feature-request`, etc.
    - By Priority: `priority:critical`, `priority:high`, etc.
    - By Status: `status:open`, `status:in-progress`, etc.
    - Contributor Engagement: `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `mentorship-available`

- **Milestones:** Use GitHub Milestones for grouping related issues.
- **Assignment and Triage:** Establish a clear process for triaging and assigning issues.

---

## Architecture Visualizations & Walkthroughs for Onboarding

- **C4 Model Diagrams:** System Context, Container, and Component diagrams.
- **Sequence Diagrams:** For key flows (e.g., RAG pipeline, lead capture).
- **Video Tutorials:** Short explainers, setup walkthroughs, module contribution tutorials.
- **Interactive Code Walkthroughs:** (If feasible) for critical codebase parts.

> Keep diagrams up-to-date and include error/failure paths, not just "happy paths".

---

## Licensing Model Considerations

- **MIT License:** Highly permissive, encourages adoption, but lacks explicit patent grant.
- **Apache License 2.0:** Permissive, includes explicit patent grant, preferred for enterprise.
- **GPL Family:** Copyleft, not recommended for broad commercial adoption.
- **Dual Licensing/Open Core:** Open-source core, commercial add-ons.
