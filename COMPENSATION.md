1. Introduction
This document sets forth the discretionary contributor compensation policy for the FlowDesk AI: v2.0 PRO system. As an open-source and community-driven project, we welcome contributions from developers, designers, and collaborators worldwide.

Contributors whose work significantly advances the system’s development may be eligible for compensation, subject to the discretion of the project administrators and lead developers. This policy is designed to reward high-impact contributions that align with the project roadmap and deliver measurable value.

Note: This policy does not constitute a contract. Compensation is evaluated and granted on a case-by-case basis.

2. Eligibility and Scope
Compensation is available for contributions that meet the following criteria:

Eligible Contributions:
Code Enhancements:
Original code integrated into the main or production branches.
Improvements to the AVA knowledge base, behavior engine, or tagging schema.
New Features:
Utility scripts, chunking logic, embedding enhancements, fallback strategies, or routing modules.
Documentation:
Improvements that enhance clarity, onboarding efficiency, or developer adoption.
Tooling and Testing:
Interface, shell tooling, or API enhancements.
Contributions to QA pipelines, test coverage, or debugging automation.
Security and Reliability:
Patches that improve system security, reliability, or scalability.
Contributor Obligations:
Affirm originality and the right to license submitted work.
Ensure contributions adhere to project standards.
3. Evaluation Criteria
Submitted contributions will be evaluated based on the following factors:

Impact: Does the contribution significantly advance the project roadmap or resolve critical issues?
Originality: Is the work novel, or does it provide a unique approach to solving a challenge?
Quality:
Does the code, documentation, or contribution follow repository standards?
Is it maintainable and cohesive with the existing system?
System Alignment:
Does the contribution integrate seamlessly into the current or planned architecture?
Integration Readiness:
Are clear documentation, tests, and modularity included to support integration and scalability?
4. Compensation Structure
The following outlines potential compensation models:

Examples of Compensation:
Flat Fees: For full modules such as a routing layer or fallback logic patch.
Micro Incentives: Small, per-line or per-tag payments for critical upgrades or refinements.
Bonuses: For contributions that significantly improve security, testing, or long-term system reliability.
Documentation Bounties: Rewards for critical guides that enhance onboarding or adoption.
QA and Testing Contributions: Payment for expanding test coverage or debugging tools.
Important: All compensation is discretionary and must be explicitly approved in writing by a project administrator. Payments are made in fiat currency and may require a signed invoice or proof of identity, depending on the contributor's legal and tax jurisdiction.

5. Review and Payment Process
The compensation process follows these steps:

Submit a Pull Request (PR):

Contributor Follow-Up:

Contributors may be required to provide:
An invoice for the agreed-upon amount.
Name and legal identification (if required for tax compliance).
Final Approval:

The decision to grant compensation lies solely with the project maintainers. All decisions are final and non-appealable.
6. Licensing, Ownership, and Legal
Contributors must adhere to the following terms:

Licensing:
All code must comply with the repository’s LICENSE.
By contributing, you grant the project a royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, modify, and distribute your work.

This policy is non-binding and does not guarantee payment for any submission.
Contributors must ensure their work is original and free of third-party claims.
7. Guidelines for Open Source Collaboration
FlowDesk AI operates as an open-source project, and we encourage collaboration from the global developer community:

Open Participation: Contributions are welcome from anyone, regardless of experience level.
Code Standards: Ensure your code is clean, tested, and well-documented.
